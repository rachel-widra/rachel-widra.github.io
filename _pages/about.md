I am a first year economics PhD student at the University of Wisconsin- Madison interested in labor and family economics. I received my Bachelor's of Arts from UW- Madison in 2019 where I double majored in economics with a mathematical emphasis and English, and minored in mathematics. After graduation, I worked as a Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland before returning to Madison to start my graduate studies.
