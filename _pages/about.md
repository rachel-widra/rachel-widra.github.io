I am a first year economics PhD student at the University of Wisconsin- Madison interested in labor and family economics. I received my Bachelor's of Arts from UW- Madison in 2019 where I double majored in Economics with a mathematical emphasis and English, and minored in Mathematics. While I was an undergraduate, I interned at a local education policy nonprofit researching the effects of school police officers on students' and parents' perceptions of school safety. After graduation, I worked as a Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland for three years, before returning to Madison to start my graduate studies.
